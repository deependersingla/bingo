<h3>About Bingo</h3>
	<p style= "text-align:justify;">
	Bingo is an addictive game which is usually played on paper with two people. Both founders of this bingo-bot used to play it in their respective colleges, especially during boring classes. During a relatively slower period in their startup life, they decided to code Bingo for fun (it takes away the challenge of finding another human being to play it and making a totally random board each and every time). 
<br><br>
	The founders hold no copyrights to the game - they don't know who founded it or when it came about. It's a mystery still left to solve. But they do hold copyrights to the algorithm that is being used.
<br><br>
	And no. Bingo isn't random. The Bingo Bot is smart, intuitive and most importantly - honest.
